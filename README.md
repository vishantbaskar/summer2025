# Java Programming Course for Middle School Students (Summer 2025)

This repository contains all the Java programs taught in a programming class for middle school students during the summer of 2025. The course aimed to introduce foundational programming concepts and develop problem-solving skills using Java. 

The lessons include a variety of exercises designed to engage young learners and build their confidence in coding. Topics covered include basic syntax, control structures, object-oriented programming, and more. The goal was to make programming accessible and fun for students with little to no prior experience.

## Course Content
